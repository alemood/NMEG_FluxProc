function ds = resolve_fluxall_header_changes( varargin )
% resolve_fluxall_header_changes() -- takes a raw fluxall dataset and
% a log of header name changes and merges the columns.
%
% This script is called from card_data_processor after asking for user
% input. Following the creation of a 30 minute TOA5 dataset (by
% combine_and_fill_TOA5_files.m), the combined and filled dataset is
% passed to this script. A header change log is read, and changed header
% columns are merged into one. Prior to merging, the script verifies that
% no data from either column will be overwritten.

%
% Variables not present in all datasets are filled with NaN for timestamps in
% the datasets missing them.  The combined dataset is vetted to make sure each
% thirty-minute timestamp within the period occurs exactly once.  Missing
% timestamps are added and all observed variables filled with NaN.  Where a
% timestamp is duplicated the first is kept and subsequent values for the same
% timestamp are discarded.  Timestamps within two minutes of a "round" thirty
% minute value (i.e. 0 or 30 minutes past the hour) are rounded to the nearest
% hour or half hour.  Timestamps more than two minutes from a round thirty
% minute value are deemed erroneous and discarded.
%
% USAGE
%    ds = combine_and_fill_TOA5_files();
%    ds = combine_and_fill_TOA5_files( 'path\to\first\TOA5\file', ...
%                                      'path\to\second\TOA5\file', ... );
%
% INPUTS
%    either a series of strings containing full paths to the TOA5
%    files to be combined.  If called with no inputs the user is presented a
%    graphical file selection dialog (via uigetfile) which allows for multiple
%    files to be selected interactively.
%
% OUTPUTS
%    ds: Matlab dataset array; the combined and filled data
