function  out  = replace_consecutive_with_condition( in, cond )
% REPLACE_CONSECUTIVE_WITH_CONDITION - replaces consecutive identical values
% within an array where a given condition is satisfied.  MCon 2012 PAR record
% features several instances of high, constant values for several days at a
% time.  This function finds these bogus data and replaces them with NaN.  The
% condition (daytime, in this case) is necessary to avoid replacing nighttime
% PAR values, which should contain consecutive zeros (or near-zeros).
%
% USAGE
%     out  = replace_daytime_consecutive( in, cond );
%
% INPUTS
%    in: numeric vector; the input data to be searched and repaired
%    cond: logical vector; same size as in; only consecutive values where
%        cond is true are removed.
%
% OUTPUTS:
%    out: data from in with consecutive daytime values removed
